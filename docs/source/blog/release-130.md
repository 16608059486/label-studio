---

At Label Studio, we're always looking for ways to help you accelerate your data annotation process. With the release of version 1.3.0, you can perform model-assisted labeling with any connected [ML backend](/guide/ml.html). By using a machine learning model to interactively predict annotations, expert human annotators can work alongside an untrained, partially trained, or pretrained machine learning model to more efficiently complete labeling tasks. 

ML-assisted labeling works best with image and semantic segmentation tasks, but can be used with any connected ML backend. Upgrade to the latest version and select **Use for interactive preannotations** when you set up an ML backend, or edit an existing ML backend connection and toggle that option to get started today!
