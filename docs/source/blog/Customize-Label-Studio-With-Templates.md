Label Studio is a flexible open source data labeling tool with a variety of templates that you can use to customize the labeling interface for your different data labeling projects. Have you ever wondered how you could do more with the templates and tags? 

We recently [revamped the template documentation](/templates), updating it with more examples, interactive previews, and in-depth explanations of how tags and templates work so that you can more easily design the optimal labeling interface for your data science projects.

You can review templates in a gallery view just like inside Label Studio, making it easier to find the right template for your use case at a glance.

Every individual template page includes an easily-copied labeling configuration so that you can quickly get started labeling:

## About templates

If you've ever looked at the labeling configuration XML behind a template and wondered how it works, wonder no longer!

Every template includes a detailed explanation of the [tags](/tags) used in the template, and what each parameter for each tag does to customize the labeling experience:

## Enhance templates 

For some templates, there's even more guidance available. For the most-frequently-discussed templates, another section of the documentation covers how to enhance the template with styling, parameter changes, and more to further customize the labeling interface. 

- Want to add a filter to the extensive list of labels for your named entity recognition task? See [how to enhance that template](/templates/named_entity.html).
- Want to make a long text sample easier to review and summarize? Check out the [enhancements for the text summarization template](/templates/text_summarization.html).
- Want to add extra details to your object detection annotations? See [how to add information to each bounding box](/templates/image_bbox.html). 

See [all the template documentation](/templates) for more.
