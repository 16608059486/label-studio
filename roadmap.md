## Label Studio public roadmap

We love open source and inspired by community-driven development. 
That's why we made our Label Studio roadmap publicly available. Here is a link:

[Label Studio Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/heartexlabs/projects/1)

If you want to contribute or make a feature request for the next release, please first read guide.

## Guide

Roadmap exposes our development plans for the next few quarters.

It is structured in columns with the following infor

**Q2 Apr-Jun**
Describes what is expected to be done in terms of:
- **Focus on** the main goals,
- **Expected release** links
- **Main deliverables** anticipated at the end of the current period.

Though roadmap reflects the most of current data annotation community needs, and shows the general direction of Label Studio evolution, it is not a final "do-or-die" document, and we let the things to be changed according to the weather.


#### Contribution

The easiest way to contribute to the Label Studio is creating a [feature requests](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues/new?assignees=makseq&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=), or check for [existing ones](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues) 
and leave your comment or vote. 

Github issues are processed in the following steps:

1. Issue is assigned to [Label Studio Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/heartexlabs/projects/1) project - it means we're on it and thing are going to happens.
2. Issue is assigned to a milestone referring a specific Label Studio version - it means you can get your feature in a public release by a specific date (the end of this milestone), or even early in a bleeding-edge version (master branch).

We prioritize all created requests according to the current roadmap. If your feature request / submitted issue is left without any badge, no worries - give it some time, we'll definitely include it later, or [ping us on Slack]() if you think it's very urgent.
